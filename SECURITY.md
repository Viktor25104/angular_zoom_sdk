# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the `main` branch receives security fixes. Release tags inherit the same patches once validated.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Email the core team (security@zoom-angular.example) with a detailed description and reproduction steps.
2. Do not open public GitHub issues containing sensitive information.
3. Expect an acknowledgement within 48 hours and status updates every five business days.

## Responsible Disclosure

- Keep PoC artifacts private until a fix is released.
- Coordinate public disclosure timelines with the core team.
- If the issue involves Zoom credentials or WebSocket endpoints, rotate secrets immediately and note the action in the disclosure.
